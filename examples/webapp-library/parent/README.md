[demo](https://precor.github.io/web-api-bridge/examples/webapp-library/DEMO.html)

The [parent](https://github.com/precor/web-api-bridge/tree/master/examples/webapp-library//webapp-library) window uses an iframe to display a full page photo from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/). This iframe is considered a `LibType1` instance of a webapp. The parent then displays a small row of four iframes over the top of the full sized photo that each display a selectable photo. These four iframes are each instances of `LibType2` abstractions. The parent supports four apis, `Api1` has a single function is supported by the iframe that displays the full size photo with a specific `id`; it is only used by `LibType1` iframes. `Api2` is supported by the smaller iframes, `LibType2` iframes. These smaller iframes use a function in `Api2` that is called when they are clicked on, to send the `id` of their photo to the parent. The parent then uses the function in `Api1` to change the full screen image. When a photo is selected the parent also uses an additional function in `Api2` to request a new photo in all of the smaller non-selected iframes. In addition, `Api3` is used to allow an iframe to turn off or on blur or grayscale. In this example code it is added to the first smaller, `LibType2`, iframe. A `Common` api is used by all webapps, `LibType1` and `LibType2` iframes, to display the results of settings made with `Api3`.
